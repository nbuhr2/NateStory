This is the story of Nathan. One day he had to display his prowess, or
lack thereof, of git for a CS 400 assignment. He began by staring blankly
at the assignment page, opening up mobaXterm, and logging in. Now Nathan
wasn't a very imaginative person, so he wrote about what he was
literally doing.

We arrived at the rathskeller, in the back near a bar
. All sitting in a booth we decided to start the project. We began by logging
 into Canvas to get the CS400 x2 team project directions. We created a public
 repository and now we are editing each others stories.
 We are all working well together so far.
 
We are all making sure that there is no conflict happening. Nathan is the leader
He get everything done so fast. He must be a genious. We are listining to music
also in the bar. Almost done in the bar.
