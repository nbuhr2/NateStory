This is the story of Nathan. One day he had to display his prowess, or
lack thereof, of git for a CS 400 assignment. He began by staring blankly
at the assignment page, opening up mobaXterm, and logging in. Now Nathan
wasn't a very imaginative person, so he wrote about what he was
literally doing.

We arrived at the rathskeller, in the back near a bar
. All sitting in a booth we decided to start the project. We began by logging
 into Canvas to get the CS400 x2 team project directions. We created a public
 repository and now we are editing each others stories.
 We are all working well together so far.
 
We are all making sure that there is no conflict happening. Nathan is the leader
He get everything done so fast. He must be a genious. We are listining to music
also in the bar. Almost done in the bar.

Somehow I finally made it here, the last edits to the wonderful Nate's story.
I couldn't be more happy to be finishing this because I want to go back to my apartment
and make some hot chocolate. The team members are lovely, but not as lovely as 
hot chocolate.

The last thing that happened was Nathan finishing his story. He couldn't think
of anything else to say, and just filled words for a paragraph. After all,
he was much better as a programmer than a writer.
