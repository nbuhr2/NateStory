This is the story of Nathan. One day he had to display his prowess, or
lack thereof, of git for a CS 400 assignment. He began by staring blankly
at the assignment page, opening up mobaXterm, and logging in. Now Nathan
wasn't a very imaginative person, so he wrote about what he was
literally doing.

We arrived at the rathskeller, in the back near a bar
. All sitting in a booth we decided to start the project. We began by logging
 into Canvas to get the CS400 x2 team project directions. We created a public
 repository and now we are editing each others stories.
 We are all working well together so far.
